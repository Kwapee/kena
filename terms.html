        entitled to make submissions to the Independent Expert including oral
        submissions and will provide (or procure that others provide) the
        Independent Expert with all such assistance and documents as the
        Independent Expert may reasonably require for the purpose of reaching a
        decision. Each party shall with reasonable promptness supply each other
        with all information and give each other access to all documentation and
        personnel as the other party reasonably requires to make a submission
        under this clause. The parties agree that the Independent Expert may in
        its reasonable discretion determine such other procedures to assist with
        the conduct of the determination as it considers appropriate, including
        (to the extent it considers necessary) instructing professional advisers
        to assist it in reaching its determination. The Independent Expert shall
        act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Independent Expert’s
        decision shall be final and binding on the parties in the absence of
        fraud or manifest error. The Independent Expert’s fees and any costs
        properly incurred by him in arriving at his determination (including any
        fees and costs of any advisers appointed by the Independent Expert)

        obligations under this agreement. The Supplier shall notify the Client
        if any policy is (or will be) cancelled or its terms are (or will be)
        subject to any material change. The Supplier’s liabilities under this
        agreement shall not be deemed to be released or limited by the Supplier
        taking out the insurance policy referred to in clause 11.1. Where the
        Client is going to be using the Product for Commercial Operations, the
        Client shall maintain in force (i) aviation insurance that meets the
        requirements specified in EC Regulation 785/2004 and (ii) insurance for
        such amounts as a prudent owner or operator would insure for to cover
        any third party liability or public liability risk. The Client shall
        notify the Supplier if any policy is (or will be) cancelled or its terms
        are (or will be) subject to any material change. CONFIDENTIALITY AND IP

        agreement and for a period of two years after termination disclose to
        any person any confidential information disclosed to it by the other
        party concerning the business or affairs of the other party, including
        but not limited to information relating to a party’s operations,
        processes, plans, product information, know-how, designs, trade secrets,
        software, market opportunities and customers (Confidential Information),
        except as permitted by clause 12.2. Each party may disclose the other
        party’s Confidential Information: to its employees, officers, agents,
        consultants or sub-contractors (Representatives) who need to know such
        information for the purposes of carrying out the party’s obligations
        under this agreement, provided that the disclosing party takes all
        reasonable steps to ensure that its Representatives comply with the
        confidentiality obligations contained in this clause 12 as though they
        were a party to this agreement. The disclosing party shall be
        responsible for its Representatives’ compliance with the confidentiality
        obligations set out in this clause; and as may be required by law, court
        order or any governmental or regulatory authority. Each party reserves
        all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights or obligations in
        respect of a party’s Confidential Information other than those expressly
        stated in this agreement are granted to the other party or to be implied
        from this agreement. In particular, save as set out in clause 12.4
        below, no licence is hereby granted directly or indirectly under any
        patent, invention, discovery, copyright or other intellectual property
        right held, made, obtained or licensable by either party now or in the
        future. All Documents are the intellectual property of the Supplier and
        are protected by copyright. Words indicating such proprietary rights may
        not be altered, covered or eliminated by the Client. The Supplier grants
        to the Client a non-exclusive limited licence to use the Documents for
        the purpose of operating the Product. Where the Documents include
        training materials the licence is granted for the sole purpose of
        completing the training. Documents shall not be made available to any
        third party without the Supplier’s prior written consent. Limitation of
        liability This clause sets out the entire financial liability of the
        Supplier (including any liability for the acts or omissions of their
        respective employees, agents and sub-contractors) to each other in
        respect of: any breach of this agreement however arising; any use made
        or resale of the Products by the Client, or of any product incorporating
        any of the Products; and any representation, statement or tortious act
        or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with
        this agreement. Nothing in this agreement shall limit or exclude the
        liability of the Supplier for: death or personal injury resulting from
        negligence; or fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or breach of the
        terms implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (title and
        quiet possession); or breach of the terms implied by section 2 of the
        Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 (title and quiet possession).

        circumstances whatever be liable to the Client, whether in contract,
        tort (including negligence) or restitution, or for breach of statutory
        duty or misrepresentation, or otherwise, for any: loss of profit; or
        loss of goodwill; or loss of business; or loss of business opportunity;
        or loss of anticipated saving; or loss or corruption of data or
        information; or special, indirect or consequential damage; or any damage
        caused by the use of the Product for any purpose other than the purpose
        originally intended for the Product. Without prejudice to clause 13.2,
        the Supplier’s total liability arising under or in connection with this
        agreement, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or
        restitution, or for breach of statutory duty or misrepresentation, or
        otherwise, shall in all circumstances be limited to the sums paid or
        payable under this agreement. Force majeure Neither party (or any person
        acting on its behalf) shall have any liability or responsibility for
        failure to fulfil any obligation under this agreement so long as and to
        the extent to which the fulfilment of such obligation is prevented,
        frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of a Force Majeure
        Event. A party claiming the benefit of this provision shall, as soon as
        reasonably practicable after the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event:
        notify the other party of the nature and extent of such Force Majeure
        Event; and use all reasonable endeavours to remove any such causes and
        resume performance under this agreement as soon as feasible. For the
        purposes of this clause 14, a Force Majeure Event means an event beyond
        the control of a party (or any person acting on its behalf), which by
        its nature could not have been foreseen by such party (or such person),
        or, if it could have been foreseen, was unavoidable, and includes,

        failing to grant a necessary licence or consent. Termination Subject to
        clause 15.3, this agreement shall terminate automatically on completion

        other party repeatedly breaches any of the terms of this agreement in

        keeping; the accrued rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities of

        this agreement shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or
        on behalf of each of the parties. A waiver of any right or remedy under
        this agreement is only effective if given in writing and shall not be
        deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. A failure or delay
        by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this agreement
        or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or
        remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict any further exercise of that
        or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any right
        or remedy provided under this agreement or by law shall preclude or
        restrict the further exercise of any such right or remedy. Unless
        specifically provided otherwise, rights arising under this agreement are
        cumulative and do not exclude rights provided by law. If any court or
        competent authority finds that any provision of this agreement (or part
        of any provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision
        or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed to be
        deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of
        this agreement shall not be affected. If any invalid, unenforceable or
        illegal provision of this agreement would be valid, enforceable and
        legal if some part of it were deleted, the parties shall negotiate in
        good faith to amend such provision such that, as amended, it is legal,
        valid and enforceable, and, to the greatest extent possible, achieves
        the parties’ original commercial intention. This agreement constitutes
        the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes
        all previous drafts, arrangements, understandings or agreements between
        them, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this
        agreement. Each party acknowledges that, in entering into this
        agreement, it does not rely on, and shall have no remedies in respect
        of, any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or
        negligently) that is not set out in this agreement. Each party agrees
        that its only liability in respect of those representations and
        warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently
        or negligently) shall be for breach of agreement. Nothing in this clause
        shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud. The Client shall not,
        without the prior written consent of the Supplier, assign, transfer,
        charge, mortgage, sub-contact or deal in any other manner with all or

        at any time assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, sub-contract deal in any
        other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under this
        agreement. Each party that has rights under this agreement is acting on
        its own behalf and not for the benefit of another person. Nothing in
        this agreement is intended to, or shall operate to, create a partnership
        between the parties, or to authorise either party to act as agent for
        the other, and neither party shall have authority to act in the name or
        on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including the
        making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any
        obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power). A
        person who is not a party to this agreement shall not have any rights
        under or in connection with it and the agreement does not give rise to

        enforce any term of the agreement. A notice given to a party under or in
        connection with this agreement shall be in writing and sent to the party

        business, deemed receipt is deemed to take place at 9.00 am on the day
        when business next starts in the place of receipt. This clause does not
        apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal
        action or, where applicable, any arbitration or other method of dispute
        resolution. A notice given under this agreement is not valid if sent by

        dispute between themselves (acting in good faith) within one calendar
        month. If the CEOs fail to resolve the matter within one calendar month,
        then either party may refer the dispute to an appropriate court or
        tribunal, or may (at its discretion) opt for mediation (in which case
        such an election shall bind the other party until a conclusion is made
        or the mediator rejects the case). This agreement and any dispute or
        claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or
        formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be
