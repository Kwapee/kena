      <h1>Welcome to Our E-Commerce Website!</h1>
      <p>
        Our Website is mainly used to by farmers to rent agriculture drone which
        will be used to fertilize their crop and also for pest control.

        An agricultural drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle used in agriculture
        operations, mostly in yield optimization and in monitoring crop growth
        and crop production. Agricultural drones provide information on crop
        growth stages, crop health, and soil variations. Multispectral sensors
        are used on agricultural drones to image electromagnetic radiation
        beyond the visible spectrum, including near-infrared and short-wave
        infrared. As drones entered use in agriculture, the Federal Aviation
        Administration (FAA) encouraged farmers to use this new technology to
        monitor their fields. However, with the unexpected boom of agricultural
        drones, the FAA quickly retracted such encouragement, pending new rules
        and regulations. With incidents such as drones crashing into crop
        dusters, the FAA and the AFBF (American Farm Bureau Federation) began
        discussions to agree on regulations that would allow the beneficial use
        of such drones in a safe and efficient manner.[This paragraph needs
        citation(s)] In 2016, the FAA published rules for commercial drone
        operations.[1] These rules require that commercial drone operators pass
        a knowledge exam, register their aircraft, and fly in accordance with
        published restrictions.[2] While satisfied overall with the rules, the
        American Farm Bureau Federation would like small adjustments to some of
        the restrictions that have been implemented.[citation needed] Many
        countries, such as India, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia, have
        implemented laws regarding the use of drones. Such laws are still
        nonexistent in many countries around the world, and 15 countries have
        outlawed all drone operations.[3] The EU plans to implement a common set
        of drone regulations for all of its members. The use of agricultural
        drones has ethical and social implications. One benefit is that they are
        able to monitor and control the use of pesticides properly. This allows
        minimizing the environmental impact of pesticides. However, drones do
        not require permission to fly over another person's property at
        altitudes of under 400 feet (120 m). They may have microphones and
        cameras attached, and the resulting concern for potential privacy
        violation has caused some opposition towards drones.[This paragraph
        needs citation(s)].One other improvement with using drones is the
        precision that they operate with. Other companies might start flying
        their drones in unregulated areas to survey their competition and the
        condition of their crops and agricultural yield. There is a large
        capacity for growth in the area of agricultural drones. With technology
        constantly improving, imaging of the crops will need to improve as well.
        With the data that drones record from the crops the farmers are able to
        analyze their crops and make educated decisions on how to proceed given
        the accurate crop information. Software programs for analyzing and
        correcting crop production have the potential to grow in this market.
        Farmers will fly a drone over their crops, accurately identify an issue
        in a specific area, and take the necessary actions to correct the
        problem.[5] This gives the farmer time to focus on the overall task of
        production instead of spending time surveying their crops. Additional
        uses include keeping track of livestock, surveying fences, and
        monitoring for plant pathogens.Both the purchase and maintenance costs
        of modern drones make them too expensive for small farms in developing
        nations. Pilot programs in Tanzania are focusing on minimizing those
        costs, producing agricultural drones simple and rugged enough to be
        repaired locally.[7] A research team from Washington State University
        has developed an automated drone system that deters pests like crows or
        European starlings from feeding on grapes and other crops. The birds
        could be scared off by the drone's noise, but researchers also could
        include distress calls and predatory bird noises
